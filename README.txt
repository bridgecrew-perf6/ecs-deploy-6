# ECS Deploy

Inspired by other ECS deploy tools out there, this Spring based command line application aims to be simple and provide a way to quickly update
an ECS service's Docker container image.

## Current Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 2.6.2
- AWS ECS SDK V2

## TODO
- Make this into a native project with one of the GraalVM based frameworks
